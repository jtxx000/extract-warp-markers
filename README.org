* Introduction

Extracts the tempo (as determined by the first two warp markers) and the position of the first warp marker for an asd file generated by Ableton Live.

Note: this utility extracts explicitly saved warp markers created by pressing a clip's save button and may not work for implicitly generated warp markers.

* Usage

extract-warp-markers [FILE.asd]

* Output

[start] [tempo]

where start is the time in seconds of the first warp marker and tempo is the tempo of that warp marker in beats per minute.
